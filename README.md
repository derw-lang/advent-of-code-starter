# advent-of-code-starter

A repo for getting started with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using Derw

To get started:

- Follow the [docs on how to install Derw and editor extensions](https://docs.derw-lang.com/guides/creating-your-first-project)
- Clone this repo
- Create a folder in `src/2023`
- Name your file `src/2023/Day1.derw`
- Create your test data in `src/2023/Day1.txt`
- Run `derw install`
- Run `derw compile`
- Then run the file generated via `ts-node src/2023/Day1.ts`

Adjust as you do each day. To get you started, you can see how part 1 of day 1 from 2022 can be solved, in the [src/2022](./src/2022/Day1.derw) folder.

If you need help, reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/derwlang)

if you want to try a prerelease with else..if support and some improved error messages, install Derw with `npm install -g derw@0.0.11-0`.

Best of luck and have fun!
